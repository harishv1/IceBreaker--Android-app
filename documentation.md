IceBreaker- Android App
Implementation:
1. Our app is an Android application.
2. We used Amazon S3,SimpleDB for data storage.
3. FaceRecgoniton was done in OpenCV.
4. The server is developed in Flask which in turn runs the face recognizer.

Working
1. User creates new profile with interests and event subscription topics.
2. User can create new events and also goto existing events.
3. At the event, user can take photos of people which detects the faces of people present.
4. On top of this it also tags the people with their profile to check for common interests.
5. This provides opportunity for user to talk to people who share common interests.
